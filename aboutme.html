	  <p>Hi, I am Lucas Lau. I am a current sophomore with the class of 2020. My family consists of my parents, my sister, and I. I was born on June 8, 2002. I am mostly Southern Chinese, but I'm not too sure due to most of my family history being lost. I mostly spend my free time of my day playing video games on my computer or watching YouTube videos. I am a swimmer, but I prefer watching basketball. The left picture at the top is when I went to Rainforest Cafe with my family for my dad's birthday and the right picture is at my sister's graduation here at Rowland with the class of 2017. I don't live in Rowland Heights, but I live in Hacienda Heights and drive 15 minutes to go to school every day.</p>
